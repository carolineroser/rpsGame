Rock Paper Scissors Game

This semester the project that we worked on in our Studio 2 class was 'Rock Paper Scissors' game. We started the program in Programming 2 and expanded on in Studio. The first version of the program was an automatic game against the computer, then we added on to show the winner of each game. 
Once in studio, we created a port 3002 server that was used to send and receive data from the game. Once the server was established, we started the trial and error process of working with a server. This server was the biggest struggle for me, as sending and receiving each click was hard.
Now, on my Rock, Paper, Scissors Game, you can play with someone else, and input your name. I had never worked or built a server before, so that was the biggest thing that I learned from this semester in Studio.
